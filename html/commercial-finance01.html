                            <h2>Commercial Mortgage</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>This is a type of mortgage for those wanting to purchase a business property as an asset gaining from rental income and value appreciation. It involves securing capital against a property which I used for commercial purposes. It cannot relate to your residence. But it can be either owner occupied or a buyer investment.</p>
                        <p>Owner occupied is where the individual owns the commercial property such as a shop and the loan is then paid off from the profits of the business. Buyer investment is where an individual owns a property but not the commercial part of it. But the individual receives income from the rental/lease payments.</p>
                        <p>This specific form of finance can be used for many commercial purposes including making improvements to a property or expanding a business. The lender will look at the individual circumstances of the person making the application and the value of the asset as well as the security offered by the individual/company taking out the loan.</p>
                        <p>We are here to ensure that your commercial objectives are met by providing you the best deal from a range of providers offering all types of commercial finance. Your needs always come first!</p>

                            <h2>Bridging Finance</h2>
                        </div>
                        <p>You may ask what is bridging finance otherwise known as a bridging loan? How does it work?</p>
                        <p>Put simply, it is a short term loan which provides quick funding with a minimum of formalities for either individual or commercial purposes. In essence it is ‘bridging’ a gap and that is why it is used in the short-term. It can be used for a number of purposes such as:</p>
                        <div class="about-content-one">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Quick cash in the case of buying a new property before the old one is sold</li>
                                <li>Below market value purchases</li>
                                <li>In cases of refurbishment or re-development</li>
                                <li>Conversion of a property</li>
                                <li>To carry out essential repairs so that a property becomes eligible for mortgage lending</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="about-content-two">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Chain breaking</li>
                                <li>Settling tax liabilities</li>
                                <li>Auction finance</li>
                                <li>Probate cases</li>
                                <li>To cover mortgage delays</li>
                                <li>To provide a cash injection into a business</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <p>And the list goes on. What is important to note is the key requirements for such a loan. A bridging loan requires something to be held on a charge as security if the loan is not repaid-usually the equity in a property or land is used as security. You will be happy to know that this charge will be automatically removed once the loan is re-paid. Bridging loans can be secured against the following key options:</p>
                        <div class="about-content-one">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Residential properties</li>
                                <li>Mixed use properties</li>
                                <li>Hotels</li>
                                <li>Property in a poor condition</li>
                                <li>HMO’s</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <div class="about-content-two">
                            <ul>
                                <li>Care homes</li>
                                <li>Guest houses</li>
                                <li>Shops</li>
                                <li>Offices</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
                        <h6>How long does a Bridging Loan last?</h6>
                        <p>Most bridging loans last up to 12 months but can also be for a longer period of time…even up to 36 months in some cases! Yet what needs to be clarified from the outset is how you will aim to pay this loan off and the lender will want to see a realistic plan to convince them that this loan will be paid off. </p>
                        <h6>What about fees and interest?</h6>
                        <p>It is important to note that the fees and interest on a bridging loan will be higher than those for a normal residential mortgage and this is due to the short nature of this type of loan, with the interest typically added to the loan sum at the end of the term. </p>
                        <h6>Why take out a bridging loan?</h6>
                        <p>There are many advantages ….</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They provide you with much needed funding within a quick period-typical processing time is between 3-5 working days from the time a first enquiry is made.</li>
                            <li>Many forms of loan do not have any redemption fees</li>
                            <li>A poor credit history is often not taken into account by lenders</li>
                            <li>Interest charges can be paid monthly or when the loan is redeemed –this will be up to you and your circumstances will be taken into consideration when deciding this</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h6> How can we help you?</h6>

                        <p>There are two key areas-that of new builds and/or refurbishment of existing property.</p>
                        <p>In order to apply for this type of finance, you must be able to provide all relevant documents and information including any planning permissions obtained to the lender to assess the viability of the project. Once approval is given, your finance will be arranged. The finance will be structured from the outset to ensure that you have the funds when you require them. Once the project has been completed or sold, the lenders will expect the money to be paid back.</p>
                        <p>Lenders assess the finance they will offer based on the end value of the development once it is finished and this is often referred to as the Gross Development Value (GDV). They will offer a % of this value. We can help you obtain what is called Mezzanine funding which will provide additional funds if required to increase the overall funding. There also other options to look at.</p>
                        <p>We will take the time to fully understand your project from start to finish and look closely at your funding requirements, then identify your options and discuss next steps highlighting the costs and advantages and disadvantages of each option so that you are able to make an informed choice and more importantly the right choice for you!</p>

                          </div>
                          <p>Asset finance enables a business to obtain finance against assets. It is similar to a loan taken out to obtain much needed assets for your business and at the same time it is a fixed term contract. Assets such as the following can be obtained in this way:</p>

                          <p>These are some of the key assets but there are also more. Of course, what you will need will depend on your business’s needs and your own requirements. It is a very common form of finance for businesses, like bank loans and overdrafts. However, it has more advantages than a bank loan as it can provide much needed cash flow as well as tax benefits for a business wishing to purchase a new piece of equipment.</p>
                          <p>A sale and leaseback of the asset frees up value within the asset and at the same time minimises ownership risk. A business can also benefit from fixed monthly payments and in some cases maintenance of the asset can be included within the monthly repayments.</p>
                          <p>There are many different types of financing options such as Hire purchase, Contract hire, operating lease, finance lease, aviation and marine mortgages, and sale and leaseback. We will endeavour to talk you through each finance option and match the best one for the asset you are considering obtaining finance on.</p>
                          <p>There are many, many advantages of obtaining asset finance, but here is our top list of reasons:</p>

                              <h2>Invoice Finance</h2>
                          </div>
                          <p>Put simply, this type of finance releases much needed cash from outstanding customer invoices which may be payable in 30, 60 or even 90 days. The funds obtained in this way are a useful cash injection into the business.  This in turn may help you to pay wages, order more supplies and invest in business equipment.

                          </p><p>Businesses can often face struggles and tight periods and therefore invoice finance may be an extremely useful way to release cash quickly. <br>There are two main types of invoice finance:</p>
                          <ul><li>Factoring and
                              </li><li>Invoice Discounting</li></ul>
                              <p>Factoring changes unpaid invoices into working capital. In this case, funding is provided as well as credit control. Therefore, it is a full service which provides you with initial funds and then re-claims the funds back from the Service Provider. Typically, the lender can give you up to 95% of the value of an invoice up front and then once the invoice is paid you will receive the balance less than an agreed fee payable to the lender.

                          </p><p>Invoice Discounting enables you to receive up to 95% of the money you are owed within 24 hours of submitting an invoice.  This part is similar to Factoring. However, the difference lies in the fact that the credit management part of it is left to you to organise and manage. Of course, this will mean that the fee payable to the lender will be less than that of Factoring which is a plus but at the same time it also means more responsibility will lie with you in recouping payments.

                          </p><p>The main benefits of Invoice finance are:</p>
